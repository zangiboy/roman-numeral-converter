#### By _**William Kulha**_

## Description

_This is a webpage that I made to practice BDD with learnhowtoprogram.com. It takes user input in the form of a string (though it must contain only numbers), converts that number to roman numerals and displays the result to the user._

### Specs
| Spec | Input | Output |
| :-------------     | :------------- | :------------- |
**Program Gathers User Input** | User input: '84' | Output: '84' |
**Program Makes an Array from Input and Coverts strings to Numbers** | User input: '84' | Output: [8, 4] |
**Program evaluates the last index of the array, the singles column, and pushes the conversion to a new array** | Input: [8, 4] | Output: ['IV'] |
**Program evaluates the second to last index of the array, the tens column, and pushes the conversion to the previously created array** | Input: [8, 4] | Output: ['IV', 'LXXXIV']|
**Program evaluates for the hundreds and thousands columns in they are present** | Input: [1, 2, 3, 4] | Output: ['IV', 'XXX', 'CC', 'M'] |
**Program reverses the array so that the numbers are displayed in their proper position** | Input: ['IV', 'XXX', 'CC', 'M'] | Output: ['M', 'CC', 'XXX', 'IV'] |
**Program joins the array and displays it on the page** | Input: ['M', 'CC', 'XXX', 'IV'] | Output: 'MCCXXXIV' |
